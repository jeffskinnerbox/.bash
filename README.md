# Bash Dotfiles
**Bash Dotfiles** is a mash up of my bash profile/resource files, scripts, functions,
aliases and other bash stuff I have created, found, or more likely ripped off from others.
Therefore, out of respect, guilt, and a morbid fear of lawyers, I maintain a reasonably
complete list of sources.  Check out the references / sources and you may find
a few additional gems.

### Bash
According to the bash man page, .bash_profile is executed for login shells,
while .bashrc is executed for interactive non-login shells.

When you login (type username and password) via console, either sitting at the
machine, or remotely via ssh: .bash_profile is executed to configure your shell
before the initial command prompt.  But, if you’re already logged into your
machine and open a new terminal window (xterm) inside Gnome or KDE, then
.bashrc is executed before the window command prompt. .bashrc is also run when
you start a new bash instance by typing /bin/bash in a terminal.

### Command Line Editing
[GNU Readline][03] is a software library that provides line-editing and history capabilities
for interactive programs with a command-line interface,
such as [Bash][01] and [Python interactive shell][02].

Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs-like keybindings installed by default
(located in `/etc/inputrc`),
it is possible to use a different set of keybindings.
Any user can customize programs that use Readline by putting commands in an `$HOME/.inputrc` file.
If that file does not exist or cannot be read, the ultimate default is `/etc/inputrc`.

### Aliases and Functions
A Bash alias is essentially nothing more than a keyboard shortcut, an
abbreviation, a means of avoiding typing a long command sequence.  Bash does
not expand arguments within the alias body, or expand an alias itself with Linux
"compound constructs," such as if/then statements, loops, and functions, nor
will alias’ expand recursively.

In Bash, a function is like a subroutine, a code block that implements a set of
operations, that performs a specified task. Wherever there is repetitive code,
when a task repeats with only slight variations in procedure, then consider
using a function.

### PS1 Prompt Generator
There are several variables that can be set to control the appearance of the
bash command prompt: PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PROMPT_COMMAND.
The tools below help you create these varables for your `.bashrc` file.

### Debuging Bash Scripts
You can get a trace of the entire execution of a running script by adding
the `-x` option to its invocation of bash (e.g. `bash -x`),
or adding `set -x` within your bash script,
or via at the shebang top of the file (`#!/bin/bash -x` at the top of the script file).

An alternative is `bashdb`.

### Install
To clone these Bash scripts and use them on another system, execute the following:

    cd ~
    rm .bashrc .bash_logout
    sudo apt-get install wmctrl python python-pip
    sudo pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper
    git clone https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/.bash.git
    ln -s ~/.bash/inputrc ~/.inputrc
    ln -s ~/.bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
    ln -s ~/.bash/bash_login ~/.bash_login
    ln -s ~/.bash/bash_logout ~/.bash_logout
    ln -s ~/.bash/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
    ln -s ~/.bash/dircolors.old ~/.dircolors

## Security
[Starting August 13, 2021][07], GitHub requires use of
[token-based authentication for all authenticated Git operations][08].
At that time, GitHub will no longer accept account passwords when authenticating Git operations on `GitHub.com`.
You will be unaffected by this change:

* If you have [two-factor authentication][05] enabled for your account,
you are already required to use token- or SSH-based authentication.
* If you use GitHub Enterprise Server, we have not announced any changes to our on-premises offering.
* If you maintain a [GitHub App][06], GitHub Apps do not support password authentication.

So for someone like myself using Git on my home PC and pushing/pulling/cloding/forking with a password to GitHub,
I need to create a personal access token to use in place of a password with the command line or with the API.
Personal access tokens (PAT) function like ordinary OAuth access tokens.
They can be used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS,
or can be used to authenticate to the API over Basic Authentication.
To learn how to setup and use a personal access token, go to [here][09].

>**NOTE:** As a security precaution,
>GitHub automatically removes personal access tokens that haven't been used in a year.

Once you have a token,
you can enter it instead of your password when performing Git operations over HTTPS.
For example, on the command line you would enter the following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
Username: <your_username>
Password: <your_token>
```

>**NOTE:** Personal access tokens can only be used for HTTPS Git operations.
>If your repository uses an SSH remote URL, you will need to [switch the remote from SSH to HTTPS][10].

You can avoid being prompted for your username and password by configuring Git
to cache your credentials for you.
Once you've configured credential caching,
Git automatically uses your cached personal access token when you pull or push a repository using HTTPS.
You can learn how to caching your GitHub credentials in Git [here][11] and [here][12].
For Linux, you turn on credential cashing via

```bash
# in terminal, enter the following
# by default, Git will cache your password for 15 minutes
git config --global credential.helper cache

# set git to use the credential memory cache
# to change the default password cache timeout, enter the following
# set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
```

## Remove Secrets from a Repository
Often when creating a program that uses
login credentials, API keys, or IP address to access some service,
you'll hard code this information into your program.
The proper way to handle such secret information is
to place it in a configuration file that is read at run-time.
This way, when the code is up loaded into GitHub, or some other public place,
you can leave the secrets safely on your computer drive.
But you know what happens, the first iterations of development,
secrets are hard coded and are mistakenly sucked up into the cloud.

## Managing the Git Repository and GitHub
* [Follow these simple rules and you’ll become a Git and GitHub master](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/follow-these-simple-rules-and-youll-become-a-git-and-github-master-e1045057468f)

Use three simple rules when using Git / Github:

1. **Rule #1: Create a Git repository for every new project** -
Every time you start working on something new, you should create a new Git repository and push it to GitHub.
1. **Rule #2: Create a new branch for every new feature** -
When creating a new feature, create a dedicated branch for this new feature,
give it a meaningful name, and commit all the code to that specific branch.
1. **Rule #3: Use Pull Requests to merge code to Master** -
You should never push changes directly to the master branch.
Instead, you should use feature branches as described above,
and open a new Pull Request to merge the feature branch code with the master branch code.

================================================================================

### Creating the GitHub (aka Remote) Repository
Goto GitHub and create the new repository

    goto https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox
    <create empty repository called '.bash'>

To do this from the commandline, let first create the local git repository:

    git init
    touch README.md
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffskinnerbox/.bash/master/.gitignore > .gitignore
    git add --all
    git commit -m "first commit"

Create a new repository on GitHub for your project.
Below I do this via an API call but you could also do this manually on GitHub.

```bash
# create the remote repository from the command line
# username & password authentication is deprecated as of 11/13/2020
# https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-password-auth/
# https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line
curl -u 'jeffskinnerbox' -d "{\"name\":\"github-name\", \"description\":\"github description\"}" https://api.github.com/user/repos

# if you wish to delete this same repository, go to github and do it manually via instructions below
# https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/deleting-a-repository
```

Now push this repository from the command line:

    git remote add origin https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/github-name.git
    git push -u origin master

### Creating Your Remote GitHub Repository
Create a new repository on GitHub.
To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files.
You can add these files when you push your project to GitHub.

Go to [GitHub][02] and create the new repository called jupyter-notebook.

    goto https://github.com/jupyter-notebooks

### Creating the Local Git Repository
Make the .bash directory, move into it, and initialize it as a git repository

    cd ~
    mkdir .bash
    cd .bash
    git init

Now create the README, bash_aliases, bash_logout, bash_profile, and bashrc files.

Also create the file `.gitignore` like this:

```bash

```

Now commit the files to the git repository:

    git add --all
    git commit -m 'Initial creation of Bash scripts for Linux box'

### Loading the GitHub Repository for the First Time
Within the ~.bash directory, use git to load the files to GitHub

    cd ~/.bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/.bash.git
    git push -u origin master

### Updating the Local Git Repository
Within the .vim directory, do a "get status" to see what will be included in the commit,
add files (or remove) that are required, and then do the commit to the local git repository.

    git status
    git add --all
    git commit --dry-run
    git commit -m <comment>

### Adding a Submodule to Git Repository
Git allows you to include other Git repositories called submodules into a repository.
Submodules are Git repositories nested inside a parent Git repository
at a specific path in the parent repository’s working directory.
A submodule can be located anywhere in a parent Git repository’s working directory
and is configured via a `.gitmodules` file located at the root of the parent repository.
This file contains which paths are submodules and what URL
should be used when cloning and fetching for that submodule.
Submodule support includes support for adding, updating, synchronizing, and cloning submodules.

* [Managing Git projects with submodules and subtrees](https://opensource.com/article/20/5/git-submodules-subtrees)
* [Using submodules in Git - Tutorial](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/GitSubmodules/article.html)
* [Git Submodules: Adding, Using, Removing, Updating](https://chrisjean.com/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/)

#### Store Credentials Within Git
To add a new remote,
use the `git remote add` command on the terminal,
in the directory your repository is stored at.

    cd ~/jupyter-notebooks

    # set your remote repository URL
    git remote add origin https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/jupyter-notebooks.git

    # verifies the new remote URL
    git remote -v

    # pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository
    git push -u origin master

>**NOTE**: Other operations
>[rename an existing remote](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-remote/),
>[delete an existing remote](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-a-remote/).


### Updating the Remote Repository (i.e. GitHub)
To which shows you the URL that Git has stored for the shortname for
the remote repository (i.e. GitHub):

    git remote -v

Now to push your files to the GitHub repository

    git push -u origin master

### Retrieving Update From Remote Repository (i.e. GitHub)
To retrieve these updates on another system, use

    git pull origin master

To overwrite everything in the local directory

    git fetch --all
    git reset --hard origin/master

Explanation: `git fetch` downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.
Then the `git reset` resets the master branch to what you just fetched.
The `--hard` option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in `origin/master`.
If you have any files that are _not_ tracked by Git,
these files will not be affected.

================================================================================

## Updating a Git Repository

### Updating the Local Git Repository
Within the .vim directory, do a "get status" to see what will be included in the commit,
add files (or remove) that are required, and then do the commit to the local git repository.

    git status
    git add --all
    git commit --dry-run
    git commit -m <comment>

### Retrieving Update From Remote Repository (i.e. GitHub)
To retrieve these updates on another system, use

    git pull origin master

To overwrite everything in the local directory

    git fetch --all
    git reset --hard origin/master

Explanation: `git fetch` downloads the latest from remote without trying to merge or rebase anything.
Then the `git reset` resets the master branch to what you just fetched.
The `--hard` option changes all the files in your working tree to match the files in `origin/master`.
If you have any files that are _not_ tracked by Git,
these files will not be affected.

### Updating the Remote Repository (i.e. GitHub)
To which shows you the URL that Git has stored for the shortname for
the remote repository (i.e. GitHub):

    git remote -v

Now to push your files to the GitHub repository

    git push -u origin master

================================================================================

# Branching
To create and checkout a new branch, do the following:

```bash
# create a new branch
git branch <branch>

# checkout a branch
git checkout <branch>

# create a new branch and switch to it at the same time
git checkout -b <branch>
```

# Basic Merging
Suppose you’ve decided that you work is complete on branch <branch>
and your ready to be merged into your master branch.
All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge into,
master in our case, and then run the `git merge` command:

```bash
git checkout master

git merge <branch>
```

# Basic Merge Conflicts
If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging,
Git won’t be able to merge them cleanly.
You’ll get a merge conflict that looks something like this:

```bash
$ git merge <branch>
Auto-merging index.html
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in index.html
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
